 * values are used for operations that would affect the consistency
 * 
 * If there is a boolean return value and you're not sure how it 
 * would be used in your implementation, ignore it.  I used boolean
 * return values in the interface generously to allow flexibility in 
 * implementation.  But don't forget to return true when the operation
